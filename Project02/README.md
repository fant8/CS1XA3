*Part 3 Simple App*:

The app is a spin on the board game mastermind where the player has to guess a randomly generated code. Instead of having
the user guess a code of colours, the user is to guess a code of four elements. Input from the user is
taken through buttons. They can guess elements, start a new game, or submit their guess. They'll receive hints based on their guesses. 
For every correct element in the correct position, they will get a blue. For every correct element in the incorrect position,
they'll receive a red. This will continue until the user guesses correctly or runs out of guesses.
